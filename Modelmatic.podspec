s.description      = <<-DESC
Modelmatic adds JSON serialization and deserialization behavior to Swift model objects so that you don't have to. It allows you to take advantage of Xcode's built-in Core Data modeling tool to define mappings between object properties and JSON attributes, allowing you to seamlessly model relationships.
